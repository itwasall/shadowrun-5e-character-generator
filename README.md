# shadowrun-5e-character-generator
A 6,000+ line mess intending to generate legal and somewhat sensible Shadowrun 5th edition characters.
## Usage
`python char_shadowrun_5e.py -f <output_file>`

`output_file` is just plaintext
## TODO
- Augmentation generation
- Finish gear generation (right now about 60-70% of items have the potential to be rolled for)
- Add more stuff from the other rulebooks
- Actually cost gear
- Properly implement all qualities that have an effect on character generation (right now about 50% of those that can influence character generation do)

## Requires
- python 3.10+
- A willingness to accept subpar code
